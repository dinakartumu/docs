The Pageloop dashboard is your central hub for creating, managing, and updating your knowledge base articles. This guide provides an overview of the main sections in the left-hand navigation menu to help you find your way around the platform.

### **The Home Page**

When you first log in, you land on the **Home** page. It provides a personalized overview of your work, greeting you by name and summarizing key metrics to give you a quick snapshot of your content status.

- **Drafts:** Shows the number of articles you have in progress.
- **Updates:** Shows the number of articles that need your review for potential updates.

### **The Articles Page**

The **Articles** page displays a complete list of all the articles in your knowledge base that are managed by Pageloop. From this central view, you can see the status, creator, and creation date for each article.

### **The Drafts Page**

Selecting **Drafts** from the navigation menu takes you to a filtered view of all your articles that are currently in draft status. From here, you can easily find and continue working on your unfinished articles.

### **The Updates Page**

The **Updates** page is where you can review and manage changes that Pageloop has detected for your existing articles. This page helps you keep your documentation current by flagging content that may be outdated. The table shows details like who triggered the update scan, when changes were detected, and the number of pending changes for each article.
